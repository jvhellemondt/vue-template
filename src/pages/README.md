Pages are specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content in place. Building on our previous example, we can take the homepage template and pour representative text, images, and media into the template to show real content in action.

The page stage is the most concrete stage of atomic design, and it’s important for some rather obvious reasons. After all, this is what users will see and interact with when they visit your experience. This is what your stakeholders will sign off. And this is where you see all those components coming together to form a beautiful and functional user interface. Exciting!

In addition to demonstrating the final interface as your users will see it, pages are essential for testing the effectiveness of the underlying design system. It is at the page stage that we’re able to take a look at how all those patterns hold up when real content is applied to the design system. Does everything look great and function as it should? If the answer is no, then we can loop back and modify our molecules, organisms, and templates to better address our content’s needs.

When we pour real representative content into Time Inc.’s homepage template, we’re able to see how all those underlying design patterns hold up.
