## The atomic design methodology

...

We discussed earlier how all matter in the universe can be broken down into a finite set of atomic elements. As it happens, our interfaces can be broken down into a similar finite set of elements. Josh Duck’s Periodic Table of HTML Elements beautifully articulates how all of our websites, apps, intranets, hoobadyboops, and whatevers are all composed of the same HTML elements.

Because we’re starting with a similar finite set of building blocks, we can apply that same process that happens in the natural world to design and develop our user interfaces.

Enter atomic design.

Atomic design is a methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner. The five stages of atomic design are:

    Atoms
    Molecules
    Organisms
    Templates
    Pages
